# Wor-Prof

Wor-prof (Wprof) is a gem for Ruby On Rails which its only purpose is to measure a RoR app's performance through a profile with different times of response. In order to accomplish that, Wprof uses ActiveSupport::Notifications (available in Rails since v4.0.2) to capture every action from his controllers. However, there's more. when using httparty in your project, you can capture every done request to external services. Do you have one or two methods that would like to know how long they take to execute? With Wprof you can find out.

Then, every data obtained can be reported in several ways, choose one from the Rails logger: database file, CSV text or go ahead and do a Post request wherever you want... Do it both synchronously or asynchronously.

### Installation 

Add the next line to the gemfile from your Rails application:

```ruby
gem 'wor-prof'
```

And then, execute:
```bash
$ bundle install
```
**That's it!!** At server execution, WProf immediately begins to work with default settings, so you won't need to configure anything if it matches with your needs, otherwise you can check **Available Settings** [here!](https://github.com/Wolox/wor-prof/wiki/User-Guide#available-configurations)
